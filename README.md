Smart-Irrigation-Mobile-App
The project described above is a smart irrigation mobile app I developed using Android Studio for a client. This app enables remote watering and provides real-time data on plant moisture, humidity, and temperature. Additionally, it features a built-in weather display showing current conditions and a 7-day forecast also allowing users to have access to watering history and ability to delete the watering history. The app is integrated with custom microcontroller sensors I designed for the client, and it securely stores and retrieves relevant data from a database.
we use the sensor as well like audrino:
